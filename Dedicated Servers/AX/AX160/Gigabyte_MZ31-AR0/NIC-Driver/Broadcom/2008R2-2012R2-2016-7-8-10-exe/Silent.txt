corresponding with the name of the product you are trying to uninstall in
HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall.

Silent Reinstall of the same installer:
setup /s /v"/qn REINSTALL=ALL"

GUI Reinstall of the same installer:
setup /V"REINSTALL=ALL"

Silent Install AND create a log file at (f:\1testlog.txt):
setup /s /v"/qn /L f:\1testlog.txt"

If performing a silent upgrade or uninstall, please make sure you do a manual reboot afterwards to avoid leaving the system in an 
inconsistent state.

During silent upgrade or uninstall, your system may reboot automatically.  If you wish to suppress the reboot, please append 
REBOOT=ReallySuppress to the end of the corresponding upgrade or uninstall command listed above. 
Note that for setup command, please use:   setup /s /v"/qn REBOOT=ReallySuppress"

In some circumstances, reboot is required before uninstallation can continue. If you used REBOOT=ReallySuppress to suppress the reboot, 
the uninstallation may be suspended. You will need to reboot manually for the uninstallation to continue.
